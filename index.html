	<h1> The Legend </h1>

		<p>The mansion loomed on the hill, its once-blooming garden dried to crispy remains. The architecture looked like a Greek ruin, crumbling and all. It was a massive site, six acres covered in dandelions and crabgrass, once enticing yet still imposing. Inside, the legends said a demon lived there, its only goal to haunt the residence until it completely decayed. Some say he was overcome with grief after a lost lover, others say he was born to bring destruction, and still others say he wanted to dissuade humans from visiting and turn it into a paradise for other demons.</p>

		<p>The few who have dared to approach the house have gone mad through various means. Bertha went to the hill in order to bless the house and banish the demon. When she came back, it took her six years to remember who she was, and for the remaining sixty years of her life, she rambled about Jesus being the Antichrist. Max and Sam dared to go to see if the demon was real, and they didn&rsquo;t come back for two years. They brought back tales of demons protecting humans, reaping their souls, and travelling to both Heaven and Hell. The priest would have believed them if they didn&rsquo;t say the demons founded Christianity.</p>

		<p>And then there was Luciana, on her way to the hill. Like Max and Sam, she did not quite believe that the house was haunted, and like Bertha, she had a background in spiritual blessings. She wore a wooden rosary on her neck, carried a glass bottle of holy water in her blue tote, and had a book of prayers full of bookmarks and notes. Her pants were thick and fitted, and she wore long sleeves to protect her unscratched skin.</p>

		<p>The mile-long trail to the mansion was fairly pleasant, a dirt road with the standard greenery of upstate New York. Pine trees, oak, ivy. Nothing seemed out of place. There was no real reason that there was no construction near the mansion&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that nobody wanted to buy the plots near it. Still, the solitude gave solace instead of sorrow. And when the mansion&rsquo;s gates were in sight, the shrubs past it were no different to the shrubs outside. The rusted black gates were open. Here, the dirt road ended, replaced by cobblestones cracked through by little green veins. The mansion must be about two hundred feet ahead, and about an acre in size.</p>

		<p>About halfway between the gates and the front door, Luciana stopped and gulped, grabbing her shoulders. It simply looked like a run-down mansion, but <em>something</em> about the air was chilling, lonely. The shrubs had less life the closer they were to the house. Browner, drier. She continued walking, slowly, fearing there really was a demon inside. She reached the front door, once white but now greyed with dirt and covered with cracked paint. She lifted the lion knocker and tapped it three times to the door. &ldquo;Is anyone in there?&rdquo; she asked quietly, almost whispering. A second later, the door creaked open.</p>

		<p>Luciana could feel her heart pounding, her thighs shaking, but she walked through the doorway and into the dilapidated living room. There were torn couches, cracked tiles, vines, and a person sitting, slumped, directly below a hole that transcended to the roof, the sunlight falling on their long, golden hair. She couldn&rsquo;t see their face from where she stood, nor could she even tell the gender of the person, but she felt drawn in by their dirty white tunic, their dulled gold tights, and the now-gone splendor they shared with their home.</p>

		<p>She started inching toward them, relaxing her posture and ready to embrace the broken soul. &ldquo;Hey there,&rdquo; she murmured to them. &ldquo;Why do you sit here, all alone?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The face looked up at her. They were beautiful, with golden skin and golden eyes, otherworldly. It was then she realized they aren&rsquo;t human, but she wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore. No, she wanted to help them.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Your name is so like hers, and yet you are not her,&rdquo; they said with a half-smile and tears in their eyes. &ldquo;Why are you here, Luciana?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you know my name,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I have been watching over the town for thirty years now. In your lifetime, she will be back,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;As far as I know, you are here to find out if I am real. But that is never why people really come here. People come to see how dangerous I am, and to provide themselves a challenge, protect the town, or as a death wish. Yet I am none of these. I am merely a lonely demon, waiting for their lover. And what is wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; Luciana said, taking a seat in front of the golden demon. &ldquo;I just came because I was curious, that is all. But you still haven&rsquo;t answered my question: why do you sit <em>here</em>?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The demon frowned and held her gaze. &ldquo;You are direct, like her. But her energy is not with us.&rdquo; They then grinned a little. &ldquo;Still, I can tell you have a good heart. You&rsquo;ve done well in this life, Luciana. You have always sought to bring others comfort. However, you cannot help me much. You see, I lost her a hundred years ago to God, and it is prophesied she will come back within the next fifty years right here. If I leave, I may miss her. If I made friends with the town, then demons would be known to humans. We cannot uphold our jobs as nightly guardians if we are known. Even now, I should not be talking to you, but I have my ways of making sure you won&rsquo;t tell others of me.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana remembered all the people gone mad from visiting, and wondered if this is what they meant by making sure they were unknown. &ldquo;I promise not to tell anyone,&rdquo; Luciana said, her voice a pitch higher than normal.</p>

		<p>The demon chuckled. &ldquo;You have no need to fear me. If you come here alone and tell the others, people will simply think you&rsquo;re mad. For your own sake, it is best if you keep this excursion a secret. The madmen you know are simply the ones who talked, except that one woman, Bertha, who knew a little too much about the demons than any clergy should know. I had to remove her knowledge of black magic, but I accidentally caused some brain trauma.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana sighed in relief. &ldquo;Well, in that case, I stand by my statement that I will tell no one. But in that case, may I learn more about yourself?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo; they asked.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Well, for starters,&rdquo; Luciana said, &ldquo;what is your name? If you know your lover is coming soon, why are you so despaired?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The demon gasped and looked to the ground at that second question. &ldquo;My name is Makke. As for that second question, grief is hard to explain to someone who has never lost a person dear to them. Yes, she may be coming back, but I neither know when nor how. I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll recognize me. I&rsquo;ve lived all these years alone, without her, after twenty thousand years of being at her side. I have neither the energy nor the desire to move and do something else while I wait.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that, even if I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine what that feels like,&rdquo; Luciana said. &ldquo;But will you really wait for her in a place so worn and uncared for? Do you think this is what she wants to see when she meets you, a defeated and lonely demon with nothing else to do in life?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke&rsquo;s body started to dissipate and then reform again. It was like a twitch, but all the particles went in random directions. &ldquo;Your words are harsh. What makes you think you have the right to speak to me like that?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I just want to help you,&rdquo; Luciana countered. &ldquo;I see you here, and I want to do what I can to make her arrival here a happy one. Oh, what was her name, by the way?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke growled a bit, considering whether to answer her question. &ldquo;Lucius. Her name is Lucius. And I will do nothing now, but for the next time, even though you mean well, it does not give you the right to insult me. There are many ways to accomplish whatever you&rsquo;re seeking with gentler words.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana rolled her eyes and apologized. &ldquo;Okay, yeah, maybe I didn&rsquo;t need to say all that. But hey, I just said what I saw. Don&rsquo;t you think you could clean the place at least a little?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think you overestimate how difficult that task is for me,&rdquo; Makke said. They sighed, and with a snap of their fingers, the holes were gone, the walls were clean, the couches brand new, and their dress sparkled with shine as did the golden tights. The last touches to weave into existence were to shape their hair into a waist-length braid and make a red and gold headpiece appear atop their head. &ldquo;See? And if you look outside, the garden is beautiful, too.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana was understandably awestruck. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re even more beautiful now, Makke. I had always thought demons would be ugly and mean.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>They giggled under their breath. &ldquo;No, no. Demons can look like whatever they want, and it&rsquo;s much easier to persuade others if you assume a form that&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye. Besides, intimidation works better when you show your threat through skill rather than through appearances.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana gulped. &ldquo;I get a feeling I shouldn&rsquo;t ask any more questions about that.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You would be correct,&rdquo; Makke answered with a grin. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s enough about me. Tell me more about yourself.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>They conversed for over two hours about all sorts of things&mdash;politics, history, relationship troubles, books, and food (the human kind). Of course, Makke would redirect the conversation whenever they felt that Luciana was close to asking something about their experience as a demon. It would be better for her if she knew as little as possible about Hell, for she was destined to go to Heaven.</p>

	<h1> The Revelation </h1>

		<p>The festival lights were grand, with shows of flying dragons and fighting tigers. There were street performers on every corner, juggling and stage-fighting and painting. Lucius and Makke wandered through the nicer jewelry stalls, looking for new pieces to add to their collections. The stalls were constructed glass buildings shaped like miniature castles, featuring some of the most expensive jewelry in Hell. The lights gleaming on the pieces provided a better picture for the wealthy buyers and an untouchable spectacle for the rest. Each piece was cursed by the shopkeeper, who would remove the curse when a customer bought the item.</p>

		<p>Lucius of Celeste, daughter of Lucifer, and Makke of Hellene, her long-time confidante and offspring of Beelzebub, had no need to respect the shopkeeper&rsquo;s curse. They were magically adept enough to deconstruct the encryption or simply create a counter-curse. However, they both derived a certain pleasure of choosing to spend the money on pieces worth more than entire devils&rsquo; lives, as it was a reminder of how small these sums were compared to their personal fortunes. <em>At least we&rsquo;re not them</em>, they would think to themselves.</p>

		<p>Lucius came across a very beautiful pair of dangling earrings, embedded with philosopher&rsquo;s stone in the center. She grabbed the box and walked over to Makke, who was on the other side of the stall looking at some dragoncoal pieces.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hey Makke, what do you think of these?&rdquo; she asked, holding the box up to Makke&rsquo;s face.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re certainly gorgeous and befitting of you, my Lord,&rdquo; she remarked playfully. Then her face turned more serious. &ldquo;However, they don&rsquo;t befit that expression of yours.&rdquo; Lucius was frowning with droopy eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? I thought taking you here would bring you at least a little joy.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Lucius sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something I would want to talk about here.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why of course,&rdquo; Makke replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the earrings back for you and we can go somewhere else.&rdquo; Lucius nodded and went over to the entrance to stare at the passersby. Makke put the earrings back where they belonged and considered buying a pinky ring for her and blessing it. After staring at a dainty golden leaf ring, she decided that perhaps a ring was too strong of a statement for now.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Okay, Lucius, let&rsquo;s&hellip; go.&rdquo; As Makke turned to the entrance to regroup with her, she saw nobody at the entrance. Makke trotted out the store and first looked up and down the street. Lucius was not in sight. He sent out a pulse to track her; she was on the next street, standing at a stall two hundred feet away. Makke hurried there before Lucius moved again. When Lucius was finally in sight, Makke saw her on top of another demon, their face to the ground. She was casting an enshacklement spell on them, which must have meant he committed some sort of crime.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Lucius, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Makke cried.</p>

		<p>When the spell was done, she got off the spirit and dusted herself off. &ldquo;Oh, it was nothing,&rdquo; she said, turning to Makke. &ldquo;Just some ruffian threatening one of the vendors.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke gasped. Lucius was smiling. &ldquo;So, do you still want to talk?&rdquo; Makke asked her.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; Lucius responded, grabbing Makke&rsquo;s wrist and teleporting them to a quiet nook on Lake Cerberus. There was a blue mist today shrouding the glowing water and the soft grass. There were no sounds save the rustling of the tree leaves in the wind, and the watcher birds Lucius had conjured herself.</p>

		<p>Makke raised her hand and up rose a grey, cushioned bench from the ground. She sat on it and tugged at Lucius&rsquo;s hand. Lucius sat down and Makke asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been on your mind lately?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve felt my life is kind of meaningless recently,&rdquo; Lucius revealed, slumping her shoulders and leaning on Makke. &ldquo;Am I just doomed to live in my father&rsquo;s shadow? What have I done for the people of Earth and Hell? We&rsquo;ve just lived in our towers, enjoying ourselves while there are people starving, dreaming of having a hundredth of what we have. It felt&hellip; good, today. To help out that merchant and stop that guy. I don&rsquo;t think I can go around stopping crime as Lucius, but maybe I could organize some force to do something for people, you know?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke smiled and hugged her tight. &ldquo;Lucius, I can&rsquo;t pretend to know what you feel. I&rsquo;ve got no angelic blood in me. I don&rsquo;t have these urges of purpose or goodwill. But I am curious to know how much we can do together. I know you can do a lot. Alone, you could wipe all disorder in Hell. Unlike your father, you know what the devils and demons are like, what they want and what they need. And like your father, you are a brilliant, motivated, and powerful angel. I want to support you no matter what, and together, I believe we can change all of humanity for the better.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Lucius chuckled. &ldquo;You sure know how to give inspiring, vague speeches, Makke.&rdquo; Makke made a playful pout and pinched Lucius&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;But anyway, Makke, you&rsquo;re right. We can do a lot.&rdquo; Lucius paused. &ldquo;And we can do more if we get my father to step down as Satan.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Makke exclaimed. &ldquo;Okay, I said you&rsquo;re just as good as your father and all, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t die from fighting him!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; Lucius said, stroking Makke&rsquo;s long, golden hair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to fight him. I merely mean to ask him to retire. He&rsquo;s been in power for twenty thousand years now, and he&rsquo;s been complaining to me about it for the last hundred. He&rsquo;s sick of being Satan, but he&rsquo;s afraid that whoever he was to hand the power to would abuse it.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Makke chirped. And with a smile, she said, &ldquo;I bet we can convince him otherwise.</p>

	<h1> The Prophecy </h1>

		<p>Luciana was passing the crisp black gates lined with rose bushes. Makke put down his pen as he felt a new presence on his property. <em>Luciana&rsquo;s here! And&hellip; Lucius, is that you?!</em> He waited for her to knock on the door before assuming his instinct was right; it could just be paranoia playing with him.</p>

		<p>Three times she knocked, and he actually stood up to open the door manually. &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; Makke exclaimed, hugging his old friend. &ldquo;How have you been? Also, uh, have you seen anyone else around lately?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana tilted her head. &ldquo;No, why would you ask? Has someone been coming here besides me?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke shaked his head. &ldquo;No, no. it&rsquo;s nothing. I think my magic reading might be a little off today or something.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Oh, well okay,&rdquo; Luciana said, shrugging her shoulders. They took a seat on the red couch. As she plopped perkily into her seat, her face began to shine with pearly whites. &ldquo;Makke, I came here today to tell you some great news.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke looked at her with big eyes and bigger anticipation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant!&rdquo; she announced.</p>

		<p>He gasped. &ldquo;Pregnant?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like, there&rsquo;s a child alive in you right now pregnant?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana huffed and scrunched her eyebrows. &ldquo;Yes? Is there any other kind of pregnant?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no. It&rsquo;s just that that would explain the other presence I felt come with you.&rdquo; He paused, recollected his thoughts, and began to inquire. &ldquo;How long have you known? How old is she?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Makke, I don&rsquo;t know their gender yet,&rdquo; Luciana corrected. &ldquo;Why are you calling them a &lsquo;she&rsquo;? Can you tell or something?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just that&hellip; I think I recognize that soul. It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Makke trailed off, his words blocking his throat.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; Luciana asked.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s Lucius. I have no doubt about it,&rdquo; Makke finally said. He then grinned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s finally here.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana&rsquo;s face dropped. She bit her lip and whispered, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke could tell something big was on her mind because of this face, but he didn&rsquo;t want to pry into her thoughts. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You&rsquo;ll be the second mother of Christ,&rdquo; Makke pointed out. (Back when Makke and Lucius were trying to guide humans on a path of salvation, Lucius had decided to come as the Messiah, Jesus Christ.)</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Um, well, I didn&rsquo;t plan on telling until much later, but my husband and I are moving,&rdquo; Luciana said.</p>

		<p>Makke collapsed onto the couch&rsquo;s handle. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t move too much, or I may run into another demon. This land is blessed to protect Lucius and me until she regains her full powers. But&hellip; will you write me to know where she is?&rdquo; His eyes shone with hope.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Luciana said, hugging him. &ldquo;And you can visit whenever you want, if you can. Before I leave, I can also help you set up a computer so we can video chat, too, but you&rsquo;ll have to make friends with the town if you want to keep up with the technology twenty years from now!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Makke hugged back. &ldquo;If it means seeing you two again, I&rsquo;ll make friends with all of humanity.&rdquo; They both cried together a fair bit, both in joy and in sorrow. After a while, Makke had a thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; Makke said to Luciana, heading upstairs to his jewelroom.</p>

		<p>The shelves were lined in glass displays of all the jewels he and Lucius had collected over their thirty-thousand-year lifespans. He was looking for this one pair of necklaces they had bought about ten thousand years ago, to represent their love for each other. They were silver chains lined in angeldust and diamond, sparkling bluer and whiter than any necklace a human could produce.</p>

		<p>He brought them down to Luciana and gently laid them in her palm. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These necklaces are blessed by Michael himself. They should grant you good tidings for the rest of your live, and keep you safe from evil&rsquo;s way. They were originally Lucius&rsquo;s and mine, so I&rsquo;m giving one to you and one to your child.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Luciana held them to her chest and cried through a smile. &ldquo;Thank you, Makke. You have been like a father to me. I&rsquo;ll make sure to come to town as often as I can to see you and so you can meet her.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Makke said, grinning. &ldquo;I would like that.&rdquo;</p>
